# sticker ðŸ¦™
Simple html template engine for component syntax and web-component library not based on jsx. I suggest to use "inline html" on vs code as extension, to improve dev experience.

# WHY STICKER?

Sticker is simple, fast and lightweight library that can be used to access browser-builtin functions to a lower level than other frameworks. More than that, the sticker template engine enable no javascript site creation with more readable source code. Another cool feature of sticker is that is all open source, so you can easily read all the code and use it for whatever you like.

## BASIC USAGE 

component.html

```html
<div>
  hello world from sticker ðŸ¦™
</div>
```

index.html

```html
<sticker>
  #use component.html as component;
</sticker>
<component></component>
```

download the repo and run the following command (after installing cargo-cli):
```bash
cargo build --release
sudo mv ./target/release/sticker /usr/local/bin
```
to have access to the cli and run

```bash
sticker
```
to see all the commands available
here are some examples:
```bash
sticker build //build the project
sticker new //initialize new sticker project
sticker comp FILE_TO_COMPILE FILE_COMPILED //compile single file
sticker update //update existing js core in the current folder
```


## USING ATTRIBUTES

component.html

```html
<div>
  hello world from sticker {{name}}
</div>
```

index.html

```html
<sticker>
  #use component.html as component;
</sticker>
<component name="ðŸ¦™"></component>
```
## USE MD FILES 

you can also use .md files as components as if they where normal html components. it is compiled to html at compile time.
```html
<sticker>
  #use component.md as component;
</sticker>
<component name="ðŸ¦™"></component>
```
you can also use md files and strings as template for you dynamic components, using the flag `compileMarkdown` in your define function. 

## USE CSV FILE
\
you can also use csv files to generate custom html from templates.
for example, let's say you have a "file.csv" filled with name in the first column and surname in the second column: 
```html
<csv doc="file.csv" from="0" to="20" var="name-and-surname">
    hello name: {{name-and-surname[0]}} surname: {{name-and-surname[1]}}
</csv>
```
the property of the csv tag are:
- doc: the document used as reference
- from (optional, default 0): the row-index to use as starting point
- to (optional, default EOF): the row-index to use as ending point
- var (optional, default row): the name used as template
\
#### ADVERTISEMENT

1) you cannot use the csv file via js, it is compiled and removed at compile time
2) you cannot use tags like table, because the parser will automatically correct it.


## USE DYNAMIC COMPONENTS
As mentioned above, sticker is also javascript friendly, so you can create your own components from js, defining them as templates string (as already mentioned, use 'inline html' extension on vs code to enable better dev experience) rather than jsx. You can also reuse your components created by the template engine, simply adding the 'dynamic' keyword in the component declaration. Some examples and prototypes:

 ```html
 <div>
  hello {{name}}
</div>
 ```

 ```html
<sticker>
  #use hello.html as hello-world dynamic;
</sticker>
 ```

 ```javascript
 import * as s from './sticker/js/index.js';
s.define({
  name: 'hello-world'
})
let component = s.append('hello-world');
component.setAttribute('name', 'world');
 ```
 \
 or using plain js syntax:
 ```javascript
import * as s from './sticker/js/index.js';
s.define({
  name: 'hello-world'
  template: /*html*/`
        <div>
          hello {{name}}
        </div>
  `,
})
let component = s.append('hello-world');
component.name = 'world';
 ```

the functions implemented for components creation/definition are:
 ```typescript  
 /**
 * create custom component and append it. node is document.body by default, Props is a Record<string, any> object that are set as property of the html element created.
 */
s.append(name: string, props: Object, node: HTMLElement): HTMLElement;
/**
* create custom component.
 */
s.create(name): HTMLElement;
/**
* define custom component ALREADY defined with sticker template engine and return function that specifically creates the component created
P.S.: name must contain '-' character
 */
s.define( descriptor: { 
    name: string, 
    watch: string[] | undefined, 
    props: { 
      onenter?: ()=>void, 
      onleave?: ()=>void,
      [key: string]: any }, 
    }
    template: string,
    markdown: boolean,
): (props: Record<string, any>, node: HTMLElement): HTMLCustomElement | undefined;
/**
* return the content of the loaded file
 */
s.load( filename ): Promise<string>
 ```


## CUSTOM COMPONENTS 
```typescript

export class HTMLCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
      /**
      * fired when the element enters the DOM
       */
      onenter(){}
      /**
      * fired when the element leaves the DOM
       */
      onleave(){}
}
```
## CUSTOM EVENTS
In the template you can also listen to events, custom or not, with the following syntax:
```typescript
s.define({
      name: 'component-button',
      template: /*html*/`
            <button @click="this.count++;">Click me!</button> 
            {{ count }}
      `,
      props: {
            onenter(){
                  this.count = 0;
            }
      }
})
```
### ::once
You can also trigger the listener once with the syntax
```typescript
s.define({
      name: 'component-button',
      template: /*html*/`
            <button @click::once="this.count++;">Click me!</button> 
            {{ count }}
      `,
      props: {
            onenter(){
                  this.count = 0;
            }
      }
})
```
### $e built-in
In each custom event in the template you can also get the event properties with the **$e** variable, as follows:

```typescript
s.define({
      name: 'component-button',
      template: /*html*/`
            <button @click="console.log($e);">Click me!</button> 
      `,
})
```
## IF ATTRIBUTE
Sticker implements also conditional rendering, based on the attributes if and else. 
```typescript
s.define({
  template: /*html*/`
      <div if="this.lang == 'en'" id="lang">
        Hello World!
      </div>
      <div else="lang">
        Ciao Mondo!
      </div>
  `,
  watch: ['lang']
})
```
The if attribute accept a condition while the else attribute accept the id of the element that as the if condition. Multiple else are allowed.

## FOR ATTRIBUTE
in the template, in s.define, you can also use for attribute to create templates based on arrays
```typescript
s.define({
  ...,
  template: /*html*/`
      <ul for="name of names">
        <li>
          {{name}}
        </li>
      </ul>
  `
  ...
})
...
component.setArray('names', ['ðŸ¦™','John', 'Bob', 'Karl']);
```
or, from the current implementation

```javascript
component.names = ['ðŸ¦™','John', 'Bob', 'Karl'];
```
### REF ATTRIBUTE
if you want to get an html element in your component, you can, similarly to vueJs, add the attribute ref to the element, than you can refer to it directly in the code as follow:

```typescript
s.define({
  ...,
  template: /*html*/`
      <ul ref="myList">
        <li>
          {{name}}
        </li>
      </ul>
  `
  ...
})
...
component.refs.myList
```

## BIND ATTRIBUTE
if you have already worked on applications, either native apps or web apps, you know the importance of the two way data binding. this can be achieved, in sticker, with the bind property:
```typescript
s.define({
  ...,
  template: /*html*/`
      <input type="text" bind="@data = myInput"/>
  `
  ...
})
```
\
then, in your script, you can access the value of the input as follows:
```typescript
component.myInput
```
\
Obviously, as the name suggests, the variable is bound to the input tag in two ways, so you can also set the value of the input by assigning the component.myInput property. The property created is reactive, so you can also use it in your html as template, as in the example below:
```typescript
s.define({
      name: 'my-component',
      template: /*html*/`
            hello {{input}}
            <input type="text" bind="@data=input"/>
      `,
})
```
\
The bind property supports up to three different directives, that are: 
 - @data: used to assign a property of the component to the value of the tag property. It's the only required property;
 - @prop: is the property of the tag that will be bound to the @data property. Default value is 'value';
 - @event: is the event that will trigger the reload of the @data value. Default event is change. It must be a valid event;

## ROUTER
```typescript
import * as s from './sticker/index.js'
/**
* create a new instance of Router and configure the routes with map object as follow: 
key of the object is the name of the route
value of the object key is the component name of the route
@example
{
  '/home': 'home-page'
}
// '/home' is the name of the route, 'home-page' is the component name created with sticker, used to create the page
 */
constructor( map: Record<string,string>, node: HTMLElement = document.body )
/**
change the root where the pages are displayed
 */
router.setRoot( node: HTMLElement )
/**
* change the displayed route and goes to the route named as the parameter
 */
router.goto(route: string)
/**
* go to the last visited page before the current one
 */
router.back()
/**
create new routes as the constructor does
 */
router.map(map: Record<string,string>)
```

## ui

```typescript
/**
* create a prompt like form with an input. the promise resolves when the x is pressed (the prompt is closed) or when the form is submitted
 */
async s.ui.ask(text, placeholder = 'insert here', value = placeholder);
/**
* set an element as draggable
 */
s.ui.draggable(element)
/**
* create title bar for your components. it is based on apple and windows ones. callback function will trigger when the x button is clicked
*/ 
s.ui.titleBar(callback, node = document.body, title = 'window')
```

## UTILS

a set of utils methods that can be used for various purposes. In current state, the utils are methods for browser sniffing.

```typescript
import * as s from './sticker/index.js';
enum browser {
      FIREFOX = 'Firefox',
      CHROME = 'Chrome',
      IE = "Trident", 
      MS_IE = "MSIE",
      OPERA = "Opera", 
      SAFARI = "Safari",
      IPHONE_SAFARI = "iPhone",
      IPAD_SAFARI = "iPad",
      WEBKIT = 'AppleWebKit',
      GECKO = 'Gecko',
      MS_EDGE = 'Edge',
      CHROMIUM_EDGE = 'Edg/',
      NINTENDO = ' NintendoBrowser',
};

enum os {
      NINTENDO = 'Nintendo',
      PLAYSTATION = 'PlayStation',
      XBOX = 'XBox',
      ANDROID = 'Android',
      IPHONE = 'iPhone',
      IPAD = 'iPad',
      WINDOWS_PHONE = 'Windows Phone',
      MAC = 'Mac',
      WINDOWS = 'Win',
      UNIX = 'X11',
      CHROMECAST = 'CrKey',
      ROKU = 'Roku',
      LINUX = 'Linux',
      UNKNOWN = 'unknown',
};
//use as follow:
s.utils.os.NINTENDO
s.utils.browser.NINTENDO

/**
 * return the actual os used
 */
s.utils.detectOs(): os;
/**
 * return the actual browser used
 */
s.utils.detectBrowser(): browser;
/**
* return the browser version
 */
s.utils.detectBrowserVersion(): number;
/**
 * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/userAgentData for more information about compatibility
 * @returns if device is mobile
 */
s.utils.isMobile(): boolean;
/**
* @returns browser, browserVersion and os
 */
s.utils.getUserAgentInfo();

```

## THREAD

thread provides some utility methods for working with threads in javascript. The threads created with the s.Thread class are not visible to the end user (you will never get an instance of worker) but is handled internally.

```typescript
/**
* create a new thread that will be handled by the s.Thread class
 */
s.Thread.spawn(id: string, code: string | URL)

/**
* true if isn't the main thread
 */
s.Thread.isChildThread()

/**
* listen for the specified message. the callback will get data sended with post or expose as parameter
 */
s.Thread.listen( message: string, callback: Function, id?: string )

/**
* wait for message to be received.
* the messages sended and received will be processed when the message is received.
* available only for one message at time.
*/
s.Thread.wait(message: string, id?: string)

/**
* expose an object to the thread with the given id or to the main thread if the id is omitted. use listen method to capture the message from the thread
 */
s.Thread.post( message: string, data: any, id?: string )

/**
* share with the specified thread the transferable
*/
s.Thread.expose( message: string, transferable: Record<string,Transferable>, id?: string )

/**
* log a message from child thread or main thread
 */
s.Thread.log( message: any )

/**
* log an error from child thread or main thread
 */
s.Thread.error( message: any )

/**
* kill the current thread or the child thread with the specified id 
*/
s.Thread.kill( id: string )

/**
* return promise resolved when the child thread end with the function kill
 */
await s.Thread.join(id: string)
```
