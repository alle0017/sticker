# sticker ðŸ¦™
Simple html compiler for component syntax. Simple static html generation. i suggest to use "inline html" on vscode as extension to improve dev experience.

## BASIC USAGE 

component.html

```html
<div>
  hello world from sticker ðŸ¦™
</div>
```

index.html

```html
<sticker>
  #use component.html as component;
</sticker>
<component></component>
```

run the following command
```bash
cargo build --release
sudo mv ./target/release/sticker /usr/local/bin
```
to have access to the cli and run

```bash
sticker
```
to see all the commands available
here are some examples:
```bash
sticker build //build the project
sticker new //initialize new sticker project
sticker comp FILE_TO_COMPILE FILE_COMPILED //compile single file
sticker update //update existing js core in the current folder
```


## USING ATTRIBUTES

component.html

```html
<div>
  hello world from sticker {{name}}
</div>
```

index.html

```html
<sticker>
  #use component.html as component;
</sticker>
<component name="ðŸ¦™"></component>
```

you can also use .md files as components as if they where normal html components.

## USE DYNAMIC COMPONENTS
 you can also import sticker.js in your project to use dynamic components creation. you have only to specify in the sticker tag that, the specific component, needs to be dynamic. then, you can use the following functions to create and modify components
 ```html
 <div>
  hello {{name}}
</div>
 ```

 ```html
<sticker>
  #use hello.html as hello dynamic;
</sticker>
 ```

 ```javascript
 import * as s from './sticker/js/index.js';
let component = s.append('hello');
component.setAttribute('name', 'world');
 ```
the function implemented are:
 ```typescript  
 /**
 * create custom component and append it. node is document.body by default, Props is a Record<string, any> object that are set as property of the html element created.
 */
s.append(name: string, props: Object, node: HTMLElement): HTMLElement;
/**
* create custom component.
 */
s.create(name): HTMLElement;
/**
* define custom component ALREADY defined with sticker template engine and return function that specifically creates the component created
P.S.: name must contain '-' character
 */
s.define( descriptor: { 
    name: string, 
    watch: string[] | undefined, 
    props: { 
      onenter: Optional<()=>void>, 
      onleave: Optional<()=>void>, 
      [key: string]: any }, 
    }
): (props: Record<string, any>, node: HTMLElement): HTMLCustomElement | undefined;
/**
* define custom component NOT defined with sticker template engine and return function that specifically creates the component created
P.S.: name must contain '-' character
 */
s.define(descriptor: { 
  template: string, 
  name: string, 
  watch: string[] | undefined, 
  props: { 
    onenter: Optional<()=>void>, 
    onleave: Optional<()=>void>, 
    [key: string]: any 
  }, 
}): (props: Record<string, any>, node: HTMLElement): HTMLCustomElement | undefined;


//where first string is attribute name, the second is the attribute value
type Attribute = Record<string,string>;
 ```
## CUSTOM COMPONENTS 
```typescript

/**
* set the attribute name of the component with the attribute value
*/
component.setAttribute(name: string, value: string): void;
/**
* set the array value in template to he new value
 */
component.setArray(name: string, array: Array<any>): void;

// you can also use old methods as component.getElementById
//equivalent of querySelector
component.get(selector: string);
//equivalent of querySelectorAll
component.getAll(selector: string);
```
### FOR SYNTAX
in the template, in s.define, you can also use for attribute to create templates based on arrays
```typescript
s.define({
  ...,
  template: /*html*/`
      <ul for="name of names">
        <li>
          {{name}}
        </li>
      </ul>
  `
  ...
})
...
component.setArray('names', ['John', 'Bob', 'Karl']);
```
## ROUTER
```typescript
import * as s from './sticker/index.js'
/**
* create a new instance of Router and configure the routes with map object as follow: 
key of the object is the name of the route
value of the object key is the component name of the route
@example
{
  '/home': 'home-page'
}
// '/home' is the name of the route, 'home-page' is the component name created with sticker, used to create the page
 */
constructor( map: Record<string,string>, node: HTMLElement = document.body )
/**
change the root where the pages are displayed
 */
router.setRoot( node: HTMLElement )
/**
* change the displayed route and goes to the route named as the parameter
 */
router.goto(route: string)
/**
create new routes as the constructor does
 */
router.map(map: Record<string,string>)
```

## ui

```typescript
s.ui.ask(text, placeholder = 'insert here', value = placeholder);
s.ui.draggable(element)
```
